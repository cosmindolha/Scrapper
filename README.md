This is an experiment!

This MacOS app will read today's articles (using SwiftSoup) from https://edition.cnn.com/markets, extract the title and the article, then using GPT-3, will summarise the article after witch will classifies it's sentiment. 

To make it work, you have to add you own OpenAI Api Key in OpenAI.swift file, search for  let openAIKey = "-------- Enter Your OpenAI API Key Here -----------"


This is a proof of concept/experiment, it will use tens of thousandâ€™s of tokens really fast, beware of your cost!

Have fun!
